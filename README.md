# OfficeCamp

[Live Demo](https://office-camp.herokuapp.com/#/)
OfficeCamp is a project management website, inspired by BaseCamp.  It uses Rails and PostgreSQL for the backend and React.js and Redux for the frontend.

It was designed and built within two weeks, and I plan to continue to tweak it over time.

## Possible Future Features
